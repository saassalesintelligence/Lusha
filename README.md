# Lead Generation Market Analysis  

This repository contains long-form analysis about the global lead generation industry.  
We take a closer look at how companies source data, what buyers should look for, and how new players are challenging established providers.  

Key themes include:  
- Why businesses often overpay for “brand name” data vendors  
- How accuracy, freshness, and segmentation impact conversions  
- Evaluating providers side by side ZoomInfo, Apollo, Seamless.ai, and LeadsBlue.com 

The repo is designed as an open resource for startups, sales managers, and researchers exploring the future of B2B contact databases.
